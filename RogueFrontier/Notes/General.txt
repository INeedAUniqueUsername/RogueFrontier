To gain Dictator powers, the player must set the 'allowDictator' flag in Profile.json

If the player has the allowDictator flag set before the start of the game,
the player can take the alternative option during the Daughters intro scene
of saying that they want to destroy the United Constellation. By taking this
option, the player suddenly gains the Dictator's power and uses it on Benjamin.
If the player takes this option, they gain the Dictator's first power.

If the player takes the regular option, they gain the Orator's first power.

Later, there will be an "allegiance test" that checks whether the player
possesses a Dictator power *that they have invoked at least once*

There will be a point in the game where the player meets the Quietus and has
the option of gaining Dictator powers for the first time. The Quietus will ask
the player to go to sleep (e.g. save and quit the game) and guide the Quietus
through the player's subconscious (e.g. set the 'allowDictator' flag in Profile.json).
When saving the game, we place the OnLoad hook to check whether the flag is set,
and automatically put the Dialog scene back up.

If the player already has Dictator powers, the Quietus will grant the player a
special Dictator power - Insurrection, which immediately resurrects the player
with an explosion. The Quietus also has this power - when they are destroyed,
they will say, "Hell cannot contain my power!" or, "Hell cannot silence me!"

If the player has Dictator powers, they may seize items from Constellation
stations at will. They can also broker a peace treaty with the Orion Warlords.

Orion Raiders will raid weakly defended stations, destroying defenders,
hunting traffic, taking items, and rendering the station out of service.
