	COMBAT MECHANICS
		Blood HP
			Characters have a maximum of 200 Blood Points
			Characters lose Blood Points to Bleeding Damage
			Bleeding Damage applies over time and decrements regularly
		Body HP
			Body parts have a maximum of 100 HP
			Damage taken can be reduced by equipped armor
			All damage absorbed by armor is deducted from the armor's durability.
				The rest is received by the body part.
					80% of the damage received is applied directly to the part
					The other 20% becomes Bleeding Damage
			When damage is taken, we take random rolls on damage and armor defense
				If damage rolls higher than 150% of defense, then defense is effectively 50%. 
				If damage rolls within 50% of defense and 150% of defense, then normal defense is taken.
				If damage rolls less than 50% of defense, then defense is effectively 150%.
