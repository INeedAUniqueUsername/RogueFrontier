_Rogue Frontier_ is an ambitious ASCII-style space adventure RPG set in an alternate universe of *Transcendence*, a roguelike space-opera game by George Moromisato.

## Build
- Visual Studio 2019
- MonoGame
- SadConsole
- [ArchConsole](https://github.com/INeedAUniqueUsername/ArchConsole)
- [ASECII](https://github.com/INeedAUniqueUsername/ASECII)

## Run
Please make sure you have .NET 5.0 installed. Let me know if you have any problems with running the game.

## Development
This game is currently a well-developed engine demo. Most of the main UI features are polished and complete. The XML type system is complete. The current bottleneck is content and story development. The following features are implemented:
- Screens
  - Title screen
  - Ship screen
  - Dock scenes
- Ship Display
  - Readout
  - Megamap
  - Vignette
- Movement
  - Gating
- Items
  - Usables
- Devices
  - Weapon
  - Shield
  - Armor
  - Reactor
  - Solar
- Energy systems
- Trading
- AI
  - Behaviors
  - Ship orders
- Powers
- Systems
  - Topology
- XML
- Tools
  - Sprite painting

## Future Work
I plan to write story and implement long-term player progression.

For a particularly advanced goal, I would like to implement station docking as a turn-based roguelike sub-game where the player can walk around ASCII-style station floors and interact with characters in person.

The second part of *Transcendence* is titled "The Vault of the Galaxy." In kind, I plan to title the second part of *Transcendence: Rogue Frontier* as "The Hall of the GALASCII" (Galactic Alien Lifeforms A la Star Control II)
