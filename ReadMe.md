# Transcendence: Rogue Frontier
![Cover](https://github.com/INeedAUniqueUsername/TranscendenceRL/blob/master/TranscendenceRL/Preview/TitleScreen.PNG)
A demo for an ASCII-style real-time roguelike set in an alternate universe of *Transcendence*, a roguelike space-opera game by George Moromisato. Developed for April Fools 2020.

# Development
For now, this game is a demo of the engine. Only one part of the starting system actually exists. A small fraction of the game story and content is present. I completed the majority of work on this engine within the last 10 days.

The basic XML structures and types for systems, stations, ships, items, and weapons are mostly done. Base combat mechanics and AI are functional. Dockscreens, especially the looting screen, require further work. There are no missions and no exact UI implemented. The code for all of these mechanics is a partial rewrite of source code from the Transcendence engine, with major simplifications. XML code for Transcendence: Rogue Frontier is incompatible with Transcendence barring manual porting, and vice versa. There are no plans to support TLisp.

# Setting
The setting is a heavily edited version of the "Human Space" world in *Transcendence*.

## The United Constellation
Human civilization occupies outer space some many decades into the future. The United Constellation is the interstellar federation that binds the majority of human colonies together. The rest of the colonies, independent of the United Constellation, follow less popular, more extreme ideologies.

## The Orator
A deity known as The Orator speaks to people in their dreams about a reconstructed, more perfect universe called the Afterverse. The Orator resides at the center of the galaxy, otherwise known as the Light Hall. Only those willing to travel to the Light Hall are worthy to witness the Afterverse. Furthermore, the most devoted go as far as sacrificing their understanding of human language in exchange for the ability to speak directly with The Orator. The Daughters of the Orator are a semi-religious order living on a monastery around a moon.

## The Orion Warlords
The Orion Warlords are a hostile faction striving for the destruction of those who seek to travel through space. Their signature item is the Orion Longbow, a capacitor-based kinetic cannon that fires faster, stronger projectiles when at full charge.

# Future Work
For a particularly advanced goal, I would like to implement station docking as a turn-based roguelike sub-game where the player can walk around ASCII-style station floors and interact with characters in person.

The second part of *Transcendence* is titled "The Vault of the Galaxy." In kind, I plan to title the second part of *Transcendence: Rogue Frontier* as "The Hall of the GALASCII" (Galactic Alliance Launching Aggressive Strikes Countering Interstellar Inquisition)
