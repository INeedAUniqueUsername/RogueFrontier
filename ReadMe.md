# Island Hopper
A twisted roguelike game about war, islands, and chicken dinner.

In a future where the mainlands have been badly bombed out by all-out war, the only hope for survival can be found on the remote islands of the oceans. In desperation after having exhausted most of their armed forces, the warring nations arm untrained civilians to fight for control of the remaining islands. Defend your civilian self with unusual gear like the extremely heavy railgun, the exotic Metal Pipe Devices, the Revolutionary Revolver, or the Gun Boots. Play with unidentified items and try not to shoot your leg off!
