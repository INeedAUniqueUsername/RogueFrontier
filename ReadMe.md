# Transcendence: Rogue Frontier
![Cover](https://github.com/INeedAUniqueUsername/TranscendenceRL/blob/master/TranscendenceRL/Preview/TitleScreen.PNG)
A demo for an ASCII-style real-time roguelike set in an alternate universe of *Transcendence*, a roguelike space-opera game by George Moromisato. Developed for April Fools 2020.

# Build
- Visual Studio 2019
- MonoGame

## Development
For now, this game is a demo of the engine. Only one part of the starting system actually exists. A small fraction of the game story and content is present. I completed the majority of work on this engine within the last 10 days of April.

The basic XML structures and types for systems, stations, ships, items, and weapons are mostly done. Base combat mechanics and AI are functional. Dockscreens, especially the looting screen, require further work. There are no missions and no exact UI implemented. The code for all of these mechanics is a partial rewrite of source code from the Transcendence engine, with major simplifications. XML code for Transcendence: Rogue Frontier is incompatible with Transcendence barring manual porting, and vice versa. There are no plans to support TLisp.

## Future Work
For a particularly advanced goal, I would like to implement station docking as a turn-based roguelike sub-game where the player can walk around ASCII-style station floors and interact with characters in person.

The second part of *Transcendence* is titled "The Vault of the Galaxy." In kind, I plan to title the second part of *Transcendence: Rogue Frontier* as "The Hall of the GALASCII" (Galactic Alliance Launching Aggressive Strikes Countering Interstellar Inquisition)
