_Rogue Frontier_ is an ambitious ASCII-style space adventure RPG set in an alternate universe of *Transcendence*, a roguelike space-opera game by George Moromisato.

## Build
- Visual Studio 2019
- MonoGame
- SadConsole
- [ArchConsole](https://github.com/INeedAUniqueUsername/ArchConsole)
- [ASECII](https://github.com/INeedAUniqueUsername/ASECII)

## Run
Please make sure you have .NET 6.0 installed. Let me know if you have any problems with running the game.

## Development
This game is currently a well-developed engine demo. Most of the main UI features are polished and complete. The XML type system is complete. The current bottleneck is content and story development. The following features are implemented:
- Screens
  - Title screen
  - Ship screen
  - Dock scenes
- Ship Display
  - Readout
  - Megamap
  - Vignette
- Movement
  - Gating
- Items
  - Usables
- Devices
  - Weapon
  - Shield
  - Armor
  - Reactor
  - Solar
- Energy systems
- Trading
- AI
  - Behaviors
  - Ship orders
- Powers
- Systems
  - Topology
- XML
- Tools
  - Sprite painting
  - Content authoring

## Future Work
I plan to write story and implement long-term player progression.

For a particularly advanced goal, I would like to implement station docking as a turn-based roguelike sub-game where the player can walk around ASCII-style station floors and interact with characters in person.

If Rogue Frontier ever gets a second chapter, it will be called *The Hall of the GALASCII* (Galactic Allied Lifeforms And Sentient Creatures II)

# Island Hopper
Island Hopper is a horrible roguelike parodying PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds with the gameplay of Dwarf Fortress and the writing of Team Fortress 2
