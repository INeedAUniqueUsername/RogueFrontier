The Orator's Revelation:            
Visions of a different universe...            
Of a universe drastically changed?            
Or of one reconstructed entirely?            
                                
...In a time far beyond what
mankind currently knows as time,
where the reality is familiar yet
altogether remade new entirely,
a different mankind grows out of
the metaphorical ashes of our
own mortal era...
                                
...But only those who are willing
to meet the Orator at their home
in the Galactic Core are worthy
of witnessing the After World...
                                
Somehow,    
you know it was more than a dream.
